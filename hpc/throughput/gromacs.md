# GROMACS

GROMACS was developed originally some three-decades ago by the Biophysical Chemistry department of University of Groningen – a public research university in the Netherlands. For about a decade then, GROMACS was an acronym that reflected this heritage – namely, GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations (GROMACS). Subsequently, however, maintenance of the software became the purview of international contributors spanning both the public and private sectors. Although homage will always be warranted by those responsible for its origin, use of GROMACS as an acronym has since been deprecated.

GROMACS is open-source software; it is currently regarded as ‘Free Software’ via version 2.1 of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
