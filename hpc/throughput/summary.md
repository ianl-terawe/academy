# Summary

## Objectives (Revisited)

Objectives for this module fell into three categories.

### Knowledge

By completing this module, the student should know that:

- HPC applications seek to maximize throughout _or_ capability  
- A cloud-based batch infrastructure is ideal for executing HPC applications that seek to maximize **throughput**
- GROMACS serves as an illustrative application for throughput-based HPC that allows a parameter space to be explored 
- Existing throughput-based HPC workloads can be easily transitioned for use in the cloud 
- The demands of productions workloads can be addressed in practice 

### Skills

By completing of this module, the student should be able to:

- Appreciate how complex scientific applciations like GROMACS are built, tested, tuned, and used via benchmarks of actual systems 
- Make use of Azure Batch as the means for executing throughput-focused HPC workloads 

### Experience

By completing this module, the student should have experienced:

- Active learning on Azure - a proactive learning experience that purposely intertwines learning with doing 
- Rapid onboarding onto Azure - an experience that emphasizes ease of use, but primes the student for next steps  
- The efficiency and effectiveness of HPC on a purpose-built cloud infrastructure featuring Azure Batch 

## Problem Statement (Revisted)

Thus, the problem can be stated **affirmatively**:

> cloud computing allows an ensemble of simulations to be maximized for throughput.
