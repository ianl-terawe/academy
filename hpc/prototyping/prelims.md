# Some Preliminaries 

From objectives to prerequisites, some preliminaries are the emphasis here. This section concludes with a framing in terms of a problem statement. 

## Objectives 

Objectives for this module fall into three categories.

### Knowledge

Upon completion of this module, the student will know that:

- A cloud-based Windows desktop is ideal for prototyping HPC applications 
- oneAPI is a standards-based offering that permits HPC code to be developed for any type of processor 
- Existing code in their language of choice can be easily transitioned for use in the cloud 

### Skills

Upon completion of this module, the student will be able to:

- Make use of a Windows-based desktop on Azure to prototype HPC applications via Microsoft Visual Studio 
- Make use of the Intel-based oneAPI toolchain for programming in Data Parallel C++ via sample code 
- Integrate the cloud-based desktop experience with GitHub for source-code management and portability 

### Experience

Upon completion of this module, the student will have experienced:

- Active learning on Azure - a proactive learning experience that purposely intertwines learning with doing 
- Rapid onboarding onto Azure - an experience that emphasizes ease of use, but primes the student for next steps  
- The efficiency and effectiveness of HPC on a purpose-built cloud infrastructure featuring oneAPI

## Prerequisites 

HPC is interdisciplinary in nature. Even though this is intended to be an introduction that places emphasis on transitioning the HPC desktop experience into the cloud, prerequisites span various disciplines and practices:

- IT - High-level, conceptual understandings of cloud computing and GUI use of Windows-based VMs comprise the IT-related prerequisites. Pivotal to the current module is use of an integrated development environment (IDE) for prototyping code - i.e., editing, compliling/linking, and executing applications. 
- Programming Languages - This module introduces Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) - a standards-based programming language that extends C++ to encapsulate parallelism. DPC++ has been designed specifically for HPC and HPC architectures that span shared and distributed-memory configurations. Though not explicitly required for the exercises in this module, some familiarity with programming languages would be beneficial. 
- HPC - At a conceptual level, an understanding of High Performance Computing would be beneficial. 

A variety of references existing for making use of Visual Studio as an IDE. Even though it is relatively new, resources for learning to program in DPC++ are readily available; where appropriate in these modules, references will be provided. HPC tends to be less accessible. However, by completing this and the subsequent two modules, the learner will be exposed to the key concepts. 

## Problem Statement 

The problem can be stated succintly:

> does cloud computing allow for a desktop experience that is tailored specifically for prototyping HPC applications?
