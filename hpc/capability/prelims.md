# Some Preliminaries 

From objectives to prerequisites, some preliminaries are the emphasis here. This section concludes with a framing in terms of a problem statement. 

## Objectives 

Objectives for this module fall into three categories.

### Knowledge

Upon completion of this module, the student will know that:

- HPC applications seek to maximize throughout _or_ capability  
- A cloud-based batch infrastructure is ideal for executing HPC applications that seek to maximize **capability**
- GROMACS serves as an illustrative application for capability-based HPC that makes use of a network of compute nodes  
- Existing capability-based HPC workloads can be easily transitioned for use in the cloud 
- How the demands of productions workloads can be addressed in practice 

### Skills

Upon completion of this module, the student will be able to:

- Appreciate how complex scientific applciations like GROMACS are built, tested, tuned, and used via benchamrks of actual systems 
- Make use of Azure Batch as the means for executing throughput-focused HPC workloads 

### Experience

Upon completion of this module, the student will have experienced:

- Active learning on Azure - a proactive learning experience that purposely intertwines learning with doing 
- Rapid onboarding onto Azure - an experience that emphasizes ease of use, but primes the student for next steps  
- The efficiency and effectiveness of HPC on a purpose-built cloud infrastructure featuring Azure Batch 

## Prerequisites 

HPC is interdisciplinary in nature. Even though this is intended to be an introduction that places emphasis on transitioning the throughput-based HPC applications into the cloud, prerequisites span various disciplines and practices:

- IT - High-level, conceptual understandings of cloud computing and workload management comprise the IT-related prerequisites. Pivotal to the current module is use of a workload manager. 
- HPC - At a conceptual level, an understanding of High Performance Computing would be beneficial. This module places emphasis on maximizing the throughput of HPC applications. 

HPC tends to be less accessible than many subjects. However, by completing this and other two modules, the learner will be exposed to the key concepts. 

## Problem Statement 

The problem can be stated succintly:

> does cloud computing allow an ensemble of simulations to be maximized for throughput?
