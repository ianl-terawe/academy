# Next Steps 

## Immediate Next Steps 

Not surprisingly, immediate next steps involve the completion of this course, as this is the first of three modules. The other two modules place emphasis on:

- Use of pre-built cognitive services on Azure - with examples that emphasize computer vision
- Introducing MLOps - through use of Azure Machine Learning, the operationalization of Machine Learning is emphasized

## Next Steps Beyond This Course 

The Data Science VM has a lot more to offer - this module has barely scraped the surface. The documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/) serves as an excellent launchpad. Topics that merit further investigation include:

- Use of programming languages other than R and Python, such as Julia and CSharp
- Use of frameworks for Deep Learning 
- Use of ONNX for interoperability 
- Use of GPUs
