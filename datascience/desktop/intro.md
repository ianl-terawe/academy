# Introduction 

This module shows you how to complete several common data science tasks by using the Ubuntu Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM). The Ubuntu DSVM is a virtual machine image available in Azure that's preinstalled with a collection of tools (see figure below) commonly used for data analytics and machine learning. The DSVM image makes it easy to get started doing data science in minutes, without having to install and configure each of the tools individually.

The DSVM is comprehensive and capable. It can factor into end-to-end workflows in support of numerous disciplines.
