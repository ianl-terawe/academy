# Workspace Introduction

## DSVM Use 

Start by opening your **Workspace**. From the Workspace panel, you'll be able to retrieve the specifics needed to _connect_ to your VM via `ssh`. We encourage you to have a shell session on this VM _active_ as you work through the sections of this module. 

The VM you have accessed makes use of a software image curated by Microsoft. Built upon a relatively recent version of the Linux operating system (Linux Ubuntu 20.04), this image includes pre-installed software required for completion of this module. 

## X2Go Client 

Optionally, for a GUI-oriented Linux desktop environment, you may make use of X2Go. For more information, see [Install and configure the X2Go client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro#x2go).
