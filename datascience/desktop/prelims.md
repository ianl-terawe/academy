# Some Preliminaries 

From objectives to prerequisites, some preliminaries are the emphasis here. This section concludes with a framing in terms of a problem statement. 

## Objectives 

Objectives for this module fall into three categories.

### Knowledge

Upon completion of this module, the student will know:

- How to make use of a cloud-based desktop for data science 
- That their favorite languages and frameworks can in the cloud the same way they are used on the ground


### Skills

Upon completion of this module, the student will be able to:

- Make use of a Linux-based desktop at the command line for data-science purposes 
- Make use of Jupyter Notebooks for programming and making use of frameworks for data-science purposes

### Experience

Upon completion of this module, the student will have experienced:

- Active learning on Azure - a proactive learning experience that purposely intertwines learning with doing 
- Rapid onboarding onto Azure - an experience that emphasizes ease of use, but primes the student for next steps  
- The efficiency and effectiveness of Data Science on a purpose-built cloud infrastructure 

## Prerequisites 

Data Science is interdisciplinary in nature. Even though this is intended to be an introduction that places emphasis on transitioning the desktop experience into the cloud, prerequisites span various disciplines and practices:

- IT - High-level, conceptual understandings of cloud computing and command-line use of Linux-based VMs comprise the IT-related prerequisites. Implicit with the use of a cloud-based VM is the ability to connect via `ssh` through use of a local client, as well as via `https` through use of a web browser (to allow for use of Jupyter Notebooks). 
- Languages and frameworks - Examples, where appropriate, are provided in Python and R. Thus, some familiarity with these languages is required. In most cases, code samples are available in other programming languages; references to these resources are provided. Although use is made of various frameworks for Machine and/or Deep Learning, only a high-level conceptual understanding is required. 

## Problem Statement 

The problem can be stated succintly:

> does cloud computing allow for a desktop experience that includes both command-line and graphical-user interfaces?
