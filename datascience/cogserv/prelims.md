# Some Preliminaries 

<!--- edit to cog serv req'd --->

From objectives to prerequisites, some preliminaries are the emphasis here. This section concludes with a framing in terms of a problem statement. 

## Objectives 

Objectives for this module fall into three categories.

### Knowledge

Upon completion of this module, the student will know:

- How computers learn to see - in other words, the essentials of computer vision (e.g., object detection and classification, segmenting objects) are covered  
- How to make use of pre-built AI services in a cloud-based setting - from their immediate value to limitations 

### Skills

Upon completion of this module, the student will be able to:

- Make use of pre-built 'cognitive services' on Azure for data-science purposes - from basic to customized use 

### Experience

Upon completion of this module, the student will have experienced:

- Active learning on Azure - a proactive learning experience that purposely intertwines learning with doing 
- Rapid onboarding onto Azure - an experience that emphasizes ease of use, but primes the student for next steps  
- The efficiency and effectiveness of pre-built AI services for Data Science on a purpose-built cloud infrastructure 

## Prerequisites 

Data Science and Computer Vision are interdisciplinary in nature. Even though this is intended to be an introduction that places emphasis on computer vision via the cloud, prerequisites span various disciplines and practices:

- IT - High-level, conceptual understandings of cloud and edge computing comprise the IT-related prerequisites. Knowledge of containerization is helpful. 
- Machine and Deep Learning - At a conceptual level, and understanding of Machine and Deep Learning is beneficial. For example, algorithms (e.g., systematic image segmentation) may be incoporated by reference only - and not covered in any detailed sense. Additionally, common terminology (e.g., training, inferencing) is employed without elaboration. 

For those lacking a background in Machine and/or Deep Learning, and/or Computer Vision in particluar, a variety of resources exist - e.g., online resources of various types that target various levels of learners. Of course, most institutions provide the required background through academic courses. Those well grounded in this subject will be well placed to appreciate this module to a much deeper of detail.

## Problem Statement 

The problem can be stated succintly:

> can computers be taught to 'see' what humans can?
