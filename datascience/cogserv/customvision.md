# Custom Vision Service 

## Overview

Custom Vision is a service on Azure that allows for scenario customization. In addition to scenario customization, the Custom Vision service features:

- Intuitive model creation – models can be easily built via simple interface
- Deployment flexibility – inferencing via Custom Vision can be deployed in the cloud or on the edge in containers 
- Built-in security – enterprise-grade security and privacy can be relied upon for both data and trained models 

Custom Vision delivers multiple benefits:

- Improved accuracy – the model improves itself as it ‘sees’ more labelled data 
- Enhanced productivity – from development through to deployment, a user-friendly interface accelerates the customization process and use 
- Deployment flexibility – customized models can be deployed in the cloud or on the edge in containers

## Context for the Custom Vision Service 

Building upon the general-purpose capabilities of Azure Computer Vision, the Custom Vision service clearly has the potential to be of value in imaging (e.g., for medical puposes). That stated, in demanding use cases involving image segmentation, it may prove insufficient. In the progression from a model inferring ‘an image of medical content’, to that of ‘an image segmented for diagnostic medical purposes’, it is recommended use be made of Custom Vision. Treating model development as an iterative process is recommended by skilled practitioners.  Although Custom Vision may not deliver the outcome ultimately desired, namely that of an image segmented for medical purposes, its use will undoubtedly inform the overall process; in so doing, risks are minimized, efforts are maximized, as the AI-mediated diagnostician is iteratively refined.
