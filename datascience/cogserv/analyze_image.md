# Analyze image

Install the client library.

You can install the client library with:

```bash
pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
```

Also install the Pillow library.

```bash
pip install pillow
```

Create a new Python application.

Create a new Python `fileâ€”quickstart-file.py`, for example.

Obtain the key and endpoint from your Workspace.

You can find your key and endpoint under ???.

Open `quickstart-file.py` in a text editor or IDE and paste in the following code:

```Python
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision import ComputerVisionClient
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.models import OperationStatusCodes
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.models import VisualFeatureTypes
from msrest.authentication import CognitiveServicesCredentials

from array import array
import os
from PIL import Image
import sys
import time

'''
Authenticate
Authenticates your credentials and creates a client.
'''
subscription_key = "PASTE_YOUR_COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY_HERE"
endpoint = "PASTE_YOUR_COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT_HERE"

computervision_client = ComputerVisionClient(endpoint, CognitiveServicesCredentials(subscription_key))
'''
END - Authenticate
'''

'''
Quickstart variables
These variables are shared by several examples
'''
# Images used for the examples: Describe an image, Categorize an image, Tag an image, 
# Detect faces, Detect adult or racy content, Detect the color scheme, 
# Detect domain-specific content, Detect image types, Detect objects
images_folder = os.path.join (os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "images")
remote_image_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/master/ComputerVision/Images/landmark.jpg"
'''
END - Quickstart variables
'''


'''
Tag an Image - remote
This example returns a tag (key word) for each thing in the image.
'''
print("===== Tag an image - remote =====")
# Call API with remote image
tags_result_remote = computervision_client.tag_image(remote_image_url )

# Print results with confidence score
print("Tags in the remote image: ")
if (len(tags_result_remote.tags) == 0):
    print("No tags detected.")
else:
    for tag in tags_result_remote.tags:
        print("'{}' with confidence {:.2f}%".format(tag.name, tag.confidence * 100))
print()
'''
END - Tag an Image - remote
'''
print("End of Computer Vision quickstart.")
```

Paste your key and endpoint into the code where indicated. Your Computer Vision endpoint has the form `https://<your_computer_vision_resource_name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`.

Run the application with the python command on your quickstart file.

```Python
python quickstart-file.py
```

The output should appear along the lines of the following:

```T
===== Tag an image - remote =====
Tags in the remote image:
'outdoor' with confidence 99.00%
'building' with confidence 98.81%
'sky' with confidence 98.21%
'stadium' with confidence 98.17%
'ancient rome' with confidence 96.16%
'ruins' with confidence 95.04%
'amphitheatre' with confidence 93.99%
'ancient roman architecture' with confidence 92.65%
'historic site' with confidence 89.55%
'ancient history' with confidence 89.54%
'history' with confidence 86.72%
'archaeological site' with confidence 84.41%
'travel' with confidence 65.85%
'large' with confidence 61.02%
'city' with confidence 56.57%

End of Computer Vision quickstart.
