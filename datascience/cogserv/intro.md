# Introduction 

Azure's Computer Vision service gives you access to advanced algorithms that process images and return information based on the visual features you're interested in.

Get started with the Image Analysis REST API or client libraries to set up a basic image tagging script. The Analyze Image service provides you with AI algorithms for processing images and returning information on their visual features. Follow these steps to install a package to your application and try out the sample code.


Use the Image Analysis client library for Python to analyze a remote image for content tags.

Get started with the Computer Vision Read REST API or client libraries. The Read API provides you with AI algorithms for extracting text from images and returning it as structured strings. Follow these steps to install a package to your application and try out the sample code for basic tasks.

Use the OCR client library to read printed and handwritten text from a remote image. The OCR service can read visible text in an image and convert it to a character stream. For more information on text recognition, see the Optical character recognition (OCR) overview.
