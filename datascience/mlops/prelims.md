# Some Preliminaries 

From objectives to prerequisites, some preliminaries are the emphasis here. This section concludes with a framing in terms of a problem statement. 

## Objectives 

Objectives for this module fall into three categories.

### Knowledge

Upon completion of this module, the student will know:

- When and how to operationalize Machine and/or Deep Learning models 
- How custom Machine and/or Deep Learning models naturally complement pre-built models 

### Skills

Upon completion of this module, the student will be able to:

- Make use of Azure Machine Learning as the means for introducing MLops involving custom models for Machine and/or Deep Learning  
- Appreciate and make appropriate use of the different levels of developer-centric options available via Azure Machine Learning - from low-code through code-centric options that can leverage various purpose-built packages as well as means for automating Machine Learning 
- Make use of popular frameworks for Deep Learning via Azure Machine Learning 

### Experience

Upon completion of this module, the student will have experienced:

- Active learning on Azure - a proactive learning experience that purposely intertwines learning with doing 
- Rapid onboarding onto Azure - an experience that emphasizes ease of use, but primes the student for next steps  
- The efficiency and effectiveness of Azure Machine Learing for Data Science on a purpose-built and fully integrated cloud infrastructure 

## Prerequisites 

Data Science and MLOps are interdisciplinary and expansive in nature. Even though this is intended to be an introduction that places emphasis on MLOps via Azure Machine Learning (i.e., on Azure), prerequisites span various disciplines and practices:

- IT - High-level, conceptual understandings of cloud and edge computing comprise the IT-related prerequisites. Knowledge of containerization is helpful. 
- Software development / DevOps - A conceptual understanding of software development from a lifecycle perspective is advantageous, as are the essentials of DevOps. Use of Jupyter Notebooks as the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Machine and/or Deep Learning would be beneficial. 
- Machine and Deep Learning - At a conceptual level, and understanding of Machine and Deep Learning is beneficial. For example, algorithms (e.g., systematic image segmentation) may be incoporated by reference only - and not covered in any detailed sense. Additionally, common terminology (e.g., training, inferencing) is employed without elaboration. 

For those lacking a background in Machine and/or Deep Learning, a variety of resources exist - e.g., online resources of various types that target various levels of learners. Of course, most institutions provide the required background through academic courses. Those well grounded in this subject will be well placed to appreciate this module to a much deeper of detail. 

MLOps remains an area of intense attention and innovation. The essentials can be understood as the combined application of software lifecycle management and DevOps within the context of Machine and Deep Learing. However, at this time, implementation specifics can vary significantly from platform to platform. 

## Problem Statement 

The problem can be stated succintly:

> as prototypes 'graduate' to production, how can lifecycle management be applied to Machine and/or Deep Learning models?
