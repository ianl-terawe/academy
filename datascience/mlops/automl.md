# Automated Machine Learning: Training and Deploying a Model

<!--- optional --->

In this example, you make use of automated machine learning in the Azure Machine Learning service to train a classify a model on an associated fraud credit card dataset. This process accepts training data and configuration settings, and automatically iterates through combinations of different feature normalization/standardization methods, models, and hyperparameter settings to arrive at the best model.

Here you will learn how to:

- Download a dataset and look at the data
- Train a machine learning classification model using autoML
- Explore the results

To work through example, open the notebook [here](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/tutorials/compute-instance-quickstarts/quickstart-azureml-automl/quickstart-azureml-automl.ipynb) with a Jupyter Notebook.
