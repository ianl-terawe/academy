# Azure Machine Learning: Training and Deploying a Model

Here you'll learn how to get started with Azure Machine Learning. You'll train an image classification model using the MNIST dataset.

You'll learn how to:

- Download a dataset and look at the data
- Train an image classification model and log metrics using MLflow
- Deploy the model to do real-time inference

Using your Jupyter Notebook, open the quickstart [here](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/tutorials/compute-instance-quickstarts/quickstart-azureml-in-10mins/quickstart-azureml-in-10mins.ipynb) from its GitHub repo. 

As you work through this Pythion-based notebook, you'll learn how to:

- Import and inspect data 
- Train a model and log metrics with MLflow 
- Deploy the model for inferencing purposes 
- Test the model service 
- Delete the model service
