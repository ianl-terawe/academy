# Some Preliminaries 

## Objectives 

Objectives for this module fall into three categories.

### Knowledge 

Upon completion of this module, the student will know:

- How genetic sequencing can be achieved via various computational tasks 
- How comparisons can be made between sequences of unknown origin relative to some reference genome, and drawn out via various statistical measures 
- How cloud-based infrastructures are ideally suited computational platforms for genomics workloads
- How genomics sequencing establishes a framework for subsequent analyses 

### Skills 

Upon completion of this module, the student will be able to:

- Sequence and compute statistics relating to genetic data through use of industry-standard software 
- Execute sequencing and statistical computations via a workload-managed service on Azure 
- Handle the computational challenge of increased data volumes 

### Experiential 

Upon completion of this module, the student will have experienced:

- Active learning on Azure - a proactive learning experience that purposely intertwines learning with doing 
- Rapid onboarding onto Azure - an experience that emphasizes eas of use, but primes the student for next steps  

## Prerequisites 

Computational biology is interdisciplinary in nature. Even though this is intended to be an introdcution to genomics that places emphasis on sequencing, prerequisites span various disciplines and practices:

- Genomics 
- Stats 
- IT - minor
