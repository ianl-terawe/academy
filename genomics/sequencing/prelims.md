# Some Preliminaries 

From objectives to prerequisites, some preliminaries are the emphasis here. This section concludes with a framing of genetic-sequence analysis in terms of a problem statement. 

## Objectives 

Objectives for this module fall into three categories.

### Knowledge 

Upon completion of this module, the student will know:

- How genetic sequencing can be achieved via various computational tasks 
- How comparisons can be made between sequences of unknown origin relative to some reference genome, and drawn out via various statistical measures 
- How cloud-based infrastructures are ideally suited computational platforms for genomics workloads
- How genomics sequencing establishes a framework for subsequent analyses 
- How the demands of productions workloads can be addressed in practice 

### Skills 

Upon completion of this module, the student will be able to:

- Sequence and compute statistics relating to genetic data through use of industry-standard software 
- Execute sequencing and statistical computations via a workload-managed service on Azure 
- Handle the computational challenge of increased data volumes 

### Experiential 

Upon completion of this module, the student will have experienced:

- Active learning on Azure - a proactive learning experience that purposely intertwines learning with doing 
- Rapid onboarding onto Azure - an experience that emphasizes ease of use, but primes the student for next steps  

## Prerequisites 

Computational biology is interdisciplinary in nature. Even though this is intended to be an introduction to genomics that places emphasis on sequencing, prerequisites span various disciplines and practices:

- Genetics - A high-level, conceptual understanding of molecular genetics is the _minimal_ prerequisite - namely, that the analysis of genetic sequences proceeds by making comparisons between genomes of interest and reference genomes.  
- Statistics - The effectiveness of the sequence-analysis process is quantified via statistics. Although the requirements are'nt overly demanding, the results from statistics need to be framed in the genetics context to be meaningful. 
- IT - High-level, conceptual understandings of cloud computing and workload management comprise the IT-related prerequisites. Although much of the domain-specific software is written in the Java programming language, there is no prerequisite that is placed on the learner. Paralleism, as the means for enhancing the throughput of computationally intense workloads is introduced from a relatively basic perspective. 

For those lacking a background in genetics or statistics, a variety of resources exist - ranging from high-school level textbooks to online resources of various types that target various levels of learners. Of course, most institutions provide the required background through academic courses. Those well grounded in genetics and/or statistics will be well placed to appreciate this module to a much deeper of detail. 

## Problem Statement 

An unknown species of yeast has been sequenced and data is available on the cloud for genetic investigation. Thus, the problem can be stated succintly: 

> genetically characterize the unknown yeast species relative to _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (a known species for which a reference genome exists).

In terms of specifics, the problem statement can be elaborated to emphasize that:

- Genomic sequence analysis will be employed as the basis of the comparison
- The outcomes of the analysis should be quantified via appropriate statistical measures 
- Software commonly used by the genomics community should be made throughout 
- Advantage should be taken of the most-appropriate cloud based services 
- Genetics-based outcomes are the key measures of success 

> **Note:**
> According to Wikipedia, at least 1,500 species of yeast are known to exist. That being the case, genetic characterization is not a trivial problem.
