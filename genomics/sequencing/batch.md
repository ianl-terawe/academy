# Genomics Workloads 

Open the Workspace for this module. This Workspace provides a _simplified_ interface for Azure Batch - a workload manager that allows you to submit jobs and tasks.

Using the interface, create a new job.

Paste the following 

```shell
java -jar ~/javaPrograms/NGSEPcore_<VERSION>.jar
```

into the "command line" field and click on `Submit`. 

The purpose of this simple task is to ensure NGSEP is running correctly via Azure Batch. 

Once complete, you should output similar to:

![NGSEP commands](/media/ngsep_commands_partial.png "NGSEP commands ref")

NGSEP is included in the software image available
